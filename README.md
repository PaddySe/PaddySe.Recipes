# README for PaddySe.Recipes

This is YARCS (Yet Another Recipe Collection Site). It's a simple site that allows users to create, edit, and delete recipes.

There is nothing special here. It is just a way for me to spend some time doing what I like to do, which is to write code.

I also use it as a way to learn and test new things.

If you want a mycht better and good-looking recipe site, try [Mealie](https://mealie.io/)!


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
